# Longest Common Subsequence
This repository contains python implementation for calculating Longest Common Subsequences (LSC) between tokenized URDU sentences.

## Honor Code
I am leaving this open source on the honor system. My implementation works for the preprocessed urdu data (1 sentence per line) as I used "\n" as my delimiter while extracting sentences. I was having issues with lengths of sentences while trying with "Û”" delimiter. If you find a fix, feel free to contribute. Thanks
